  <h1>This is for my project which I will talk about some stuff</h1>
  <p>This website is about how the reproductive system works</p>
  
  <p>There's two types of reproduction, Asexual reproduction and Sexual reproduction</p>

  <h2>Asexual reproduction</h2>

  <p>Asexual reproduction by the word Asexual It Doesn't Need Any Type of Cells Other
    Than the Parent Cell To Reproduce, It Doesn't Need an Egg cell or Sperm Cells That's
  Basic Explanation</p>
  
  <h3>Sexual reproduction</h3>

  <p>Sexual reproduction is the type of reproduction that needed Sperm cell and Egg Cells.
  This type of reproduction is the most common type of reproduction but Asexual is common 
  also. If the Egg cells and Sperm cells meet it will eventually turn into an embryo and
  will turn into a fetus and eventually a baby.</p>

  <h4>Now if you watched the video that's how sexual reproduction works. Now this is the
    link for how Asexual reproduction works</h4>

  <h5>Note: This next topic only happens in Sexual Reproduction</h5>

  <p>The next topic I will make for this project is about phenotypic 
    sex and genotypic sex. There are two types of phenotypic sex as we all know:
     XY chromosome and XX chromosome. XX is for girls, and XY is for boys. Normally,
      we all start out as girls (XX chromosome), but when an XY chromosome appears, the egg 
      cell or embryo will start to go on the pathway of becoming a boy. However, there is 
      still a chance that the fetus will develop as a girl. Now, moving on to genotypic 
      sex or genotypes: this is the genetic makeup of an individual, determining whether
       the embryo will be a girl or a boy. It's the final stage of the decision-making
        process of the cells, deciding which developmental pathway it will take. </p>
